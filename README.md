# README

Members of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository ( https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-gglpubsub ) as part of the TC's chartered work (__i.e.__, the program of work and deliverables described in its [charter](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work), are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), [IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies, similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc. While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from [OASIS TC Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are used for development of open source [licensed](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) content.

## Description

This Committee Note provides an overview of OpenC2 TC members'
experience using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Pub/Sub messaging to transfer OpenC2 messages.

Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Pub/Sub (i.e., publish / subscribe) is an asynchronous communication method that enables messages to be exchanged without knowing the identity of the sender or recipient. 

This document describes the use of GCP Pub/Sub as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 messages, and captures experience and lessons learned from utilizing GCP Pub/Sub at the January 2020 OpenC2 Plug Fest. The information contained within this document can be
applied when using the GCP Pub/Sub implementation for conveying OpenC2 command and response messages, and may also be useful with other publish / subscribe protocol implementations.
